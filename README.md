--------

##Wifi Cleanflight configurator

This project was inspired by https://github.com/israellot/esp-ginx and https://github.com/beckdac/ESP8266-transparent-bridge

At this point it allows connectivity between Naze32 Board and any Wifi-enabled device

WiFi dongle creates a websocked and relays all IO to UART. This project can be extended to host web interface for Cleanflight configuration.
